# [Logistic Regression Classifier](https://github.com/KrishnaGarg/ml-uic-assignments/tree/master/Logistic%20Regression%20Classifier)

Goal is to build a **spam e-mail classifier** based on Logistic Regression.
Second part deals with adding an L2 regularization to the objective function.
Refer [this](https://github.com/KrishnaGarg/ml-uic-assignments/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression%20Classifier/Problem%203.pdf) for the complete problem statement.

## Dataset:
[Spambase Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase)
The spambase dataset consists of continuous variables/features extracted from email data like the frequency of certain words and characters.

Dataset files included in the folder:
[spambase-train.csv](https://github.com/KrishnaGarg/ml-uic-assignments/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression%20Classifier/spambasetrain.csv)
[spambase-test.csv](https://github.com/KrishnaGarg/ml-uic-assignments/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression%20Classifier/spambasetest.csv)

See [this](https://github.com/KrishnaGarg/ml-uic-assignments/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression%20Classifier/Results.pdf) for the results and analysis.

# [Naive Bayes Classification](https://github.com/KrishnaGarg/ml-uic-assignments/tree/master/Naive%20Bayes%20Classification)

Goal is to classify the SMS messages as either SPAM or HAM.
Refer [this](https://github.com/KrishnaGarg/ml-uic-assignments/blob/master/Naive%20Bayes%20Classification/Problem%204.pdf) for the complete problem statement.

## Dataset:
[SMS Spam Collection Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection)

Dataset files included in the folder:
[SMSSpamCollection](https://github.com/KrishnaGarg/ml-uic-assignments/blob/master/Naive%20Bayes%20Classification/SMSSpamCollection)

See [this](https://github.com/KrishnaGarg/ml-uic-assignments/blob/master/Naive%20Bayes%20Classification/Results.pdf) for the results and analysis.

# [K Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/KrishnaGarg/ml-uic-assignments/tree/master/k%20Nearest%20Neighbors)
Refer [this](https://github.com/KrishnaGarg/ml-uic-assignments/blob/master/k%20Nearest%20Neighbors/Problem%204.pdf) for the complete problem statement.

## Optical Character Recognition:
Goal is to implement 1-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and **Cross-Fold Validation** and analyze how the classification error varies with different number of training examples.

Fetch **MNIST dataset** using the script [here](https://github.com/KrishnaGarg/ml-uic-assignments/blob/master/k%20Nearest%20Neighbors/mnist.py)

## Iris Plant Recognition
Goal is to analyze the robustness of the classifier with varying outliers.

Dataset file included in the folder: [iris.csv](https://github.com/KrishnaGarg/ml-uic-assignments/blob/master/k%20Nearest%20Neighbors/iris.csv)

See [this](https://github.com/KrishnaGarg/ml-uic-assignments/blob/master/k%20Nearest%20Neighbors/Results.pdf) for the results and analysis.
